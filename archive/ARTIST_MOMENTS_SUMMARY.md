  tags: ['keyword1', 'keyword2', 'keyword3'],

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Intimate, not Instagram**
This isn't a feed of perfect moments. It's a diary, a sketchbook, a window into the creative life.

**Story over style**
Beautiful design supports the narrative, never overshadows it.

**Authentic over polished**
Raw honesty connects more than perfect presentation.

**Process over product**
Show the journey, not just the destination.

---

**Artist Moments transforms your portfolio from a static gallery into a living, breathing creative journal.** It invites visitors to know you, not just your work.
